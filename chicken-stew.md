# Chicken stew, or Rasse waala chicken

## This is not a recipe! It's method for generating recipes

This is my number 1 favorite recipe of all time because it is so incredibly
versatile. It can be weeknight dinner. It can be the centrepiece of an elaborate
Indian meal for discerning Indian family. It can be the main course at a dinner
party. It can be made in enormous batches and last two people an entire week. It
can be made as spicy or as mild as I need depending on who I'm feeding. It can
be made with whatever's in the pantry and the fridge. It can be made without
access to any "Indian" ingredients at all!

How can it be so versatile? The answer is that this is really a recipe
*template*, a family of recipes, an algorithm for constructing recipes, rather
than a single recipe. At its core is a simple structure with parts that can be
varied according to what's at hand and what problem you're trying to solve.

But before we get into all that, let's see the classic version written out. I
say "the" classic version as if there is an authority on this stuff. There is
not. But what follows is a recipe that can be cooked nearly anywhere, using
tools and ingredients commonly available in most countries, with just a single
"Indian" ingredient, cumin seeds. It will produce a reliably delicious result
that is instantly recognizable as an Indian chicken stew. It is surprisingly
good for how easy it is. You can double, triple, quadruple or literally 10x this
recipe and it will work just fine. You can change the relative quantities of
ingredients by large proportions and the result will still be good. You can
leave it cooking for twice as long as directed and it will still be good. It is,
in short, *robust* to variations in ingredients, cooking times, knifework,
available tools and nearly any other dimension I can think of to measure
robustness. Its greatest failing is that it uses chicken, so it cannot trivially
feed vegans and vegetarians. But even that failing is not so serious! We will
later see how it can be easily modified to get rid of the chicken.

Let us begin.

## The classic

### Ingredients
* 2tbsp oil. Any cooking oil will do. 
* 1tsp cumin seeds. You need whole seeds for this. We will see later how to
  modify it to either get rid of cumin seeds or use cumin powder instead.
* 1 onion. It can be yellow, red, or white. It can be small, medium or large.
  Cut it into long, thin slices.
* Salt. Any kind of salt will do.
* 2 fresh tomatoes or 1 cup canned tomato, diced.
* 2lb chicken thighs and/or legs. Bone-in, skin-off is best but at least in the
  Northeastern US that configuration is not commonly sold pre-packaged. That's
  ok. This recipe will work with anything.
* (optional) 1tsp turmeric powder.
* (optional) 1/2tsp red chilli powder or flakes.
* (optional but highly recommended) 1 handful fresh cilantro leaves and stems,
  chopped.
* (optional but highly recommended) white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or
  lime or lemon juice

### Equipment
* A pot. I often use a pressure cooker for this but it's definitely not
  required. Use a large pot, like a dutch oven or a stock pot.
* Wooden spatula. I suppose it doesn't need to be wooden but you need some kind
  of stirry-mixy-cooky stick.

### A note on the timing of tempering

Before starting, make sure the onion is fully sliced and near at hand. There is
only one step in this recipe where timing is important, and that is when the
onions go in 30s-1min after the cumin seeds. The cumin seeds are small and dry
and alone in the hot oil. They heat quickly and release their flavor as
fat-soluble compounds which get absorbed by the oil. This is good! This is
excellent! This is exactly what we want! But let them stay much longer and they
will start to burn.

That is where the onion comes in. It's composed mostly of water and, like,
there's a whole onion's worth of it. When you add it to the oil and cumin seeds
it will instantly lower the temperature, and the high water content means that
the temperate won't go above the boiling point of water until most of it has
evaporated away. The boiling point of water is far below the kinds of
temperature where cumin seeds start burning. That last statement had better be
true because the stew, which will certainly contain cumin seeds, will be at or
near the boiling point of water for a solid chunk of time.

In short, you need the onion ready to go to stop the cumin from burning.

### Method

1. Heat oil in the pot on medium heat until it's shimmering.
2. Add the cumin seeds and stir them around with your stick. Wait about 30s to a
   minute and dump in the onions! 
3. Stir the onions around with your stick. Add about 1tsp of salt at this point.
   Keep stirring. Your job is make sure the cumin seeds aren't all at the bottom
   of the pan getting burnt. You should see them covering the onions and
   distributed evenly throughout. 
4. Wait until the onions are golden-brown, about 5-10min depending on a bunch of
   factors like their water content, the power output of your burner, the
   steepness and height of your pot's walls (which influences how quickly water
   can fully evaporate and thus allow temperatures to rise above its boiling
   point), and the altitude (which affects the boiling point of liquids, most
   pertinently water). Resist the urge to poke at the onions too much, but do
   give them a stir once in a while to prevent the bottoms from getting burned. 
5. Dump in the tomatoes.
6. If you are using turmeric and/or red chilli powder, add them now.
7. Stir the whole thing around for a bit and wait until the water from the
   tomatoes evaporates. The visual cue is "giving off oil" (*tel chhootna*),
   which means that you should be able to see little puddles of oil on the
   bottom of the pan at the edges of the cooking tomato+onion mixture. Another
   visual cue is that there will no longer be an even surface of watery liquid.
   Another visual cue, related to that, is that there will not be active
   bubbling, because there isn't enough liquid to be bubbling. Another visual
   cue is that there will be less steam above the pot: there is less water and
   therefore less steam being produced. An aural cue is that you will hear more
   sputtering and sizzling. That happens because the temperature can rise above
   the boiling point of water, at least locally in parts of the mixture
   depending on how it's piled up and how evenly heated the bottom of your pan
   is, which in turn depends on how good of a conductor of heat it is made of.
8. Add the chicken and 4 cups of water (2 if using pressure cooker). Bring to a
   boil, reduce to simmer and cover.
9. Cook 30min, or about 12-15min if using a pressure cooker. You may need to add
   more water at points depending on how tight a seal your pot lid forms.
10. At this point the chicken should be cooked. Use your favorite method to
   confirm that: a digital thermometer inserted into the thickest part should
   read 165 F or higher, or just cut it open and see whether the meat is fully
   white and opaque, not pink or translucent. Exercise your judgement here!
   Undercooked chicken can be dangerous and, more importantly, is disgusting to
   eat. You are presumably an adult and can tell cooked chicken from raw, but if
   you mistrust your estimation skills then just use a thermometer.
12. Adjust salt and acid: add a bit of salt, stir it around, then taste a bit of
    the liquid. Is it yummy? If no, add a little bit more salt. Similarly
    vinegar. Seasoning a soup or stew is a critical skill. It is not difficult
    but you must be confident and not under-season it. Your guests, if they are
    not themselves cooks, may not be able to tell you have under-seasoned the
    food. To them, it will simply be "not delicious". That's really sad because
    the fix is so simple! Just take the couple minutes to season it correctly at
    the end. If you are new to this you will quickly get faster and better at
    this. This is a particularly forgiving recipe because you can fix the
    mistake of over-salting or over-vinegaring by adding some more water.
11. If using cilantro leaves, dump them in now and stir them around.

Serve with hot white rice or pita bread, or just eat on its own.
