# Kerala Fish Curry

## Ingredients
* 2 shallot
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 inch ginger
* 1/3 unripe mango (ambi)
* coconut oil
* 1tsp fenugreek seed
* 1tsp mustard seed
* (optional) whole red dry chilli peppers
* around 10-15 curry leaves
* 1tsp turmeric
* 2tsp chilli powder
* 2lb of any white fish
* (optional) fresh green chilli peppers
* 2 cup coconut milk
* 1 tomato

## Method

### Prep

Smash the shallot, garlic and ginger with a mortar and pestle, or just chop
roughly with a knife.

Slice the green mango.

Slice the green chilli peppers lengthwise (if using).

Slice the tomato.

### Temper whole spices and prepare masala

Heat oil in a pan. Add the fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, whole red chilli
peppers (if using) and curry leaves. Once they've been crackling for a few
seconds, add the smashed aromatics to stop spices from burning.

Once the aromatics are browned, add the turmeric and red chilli powder, a splash
of water and the green mango. Let the mixture cook for a few minutes, until
green mango is soft, turmeric loses its raw smell and everything has melded
together a little.

### Cook fish

Add the fish. There should be about inch of liquid. The fish should be sitting
partly out of the water, like a braise. Add the green chilli peppers at this
point (if using). Cover and cook for 15min or so.

### Finish with coconut milk and tomato

Add coconut milk and bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer. Place tomato slices
on top, cover and serve.

## Variations

### Vary the acid

The green mango can be replaced with another acidic liquid ingredient: dried
tamarind that has been soaked and rehydrated; vinegar; tomato pulp or puree.

### Vary the form of coconut

The coconut milk can be replaced with grated fresh coconut or dried coconut
flakes. In that case, add the coconut earlier, with the acid.
