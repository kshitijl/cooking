# Yam and lamb kababs

## Ingredients
1 medium sized yam
1 yellow onion
1lb ground lamb
1lb ground beef, or just more lamb
4tbsp whole milk yogurt
2-4 hot peppers or to taste
2 tbsp garam masala powder
2 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp red chilli powder
2 tsp salt
2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
Oil for frying

## Method

### Roast the yam

Set oven to 400F. Put yam on a tray or sheet. Poke it with a fork to let off
steam. Bake until the interior flesh is cooked through to the center. Poke it
with a fork to test doneness. It should be soft enough that you can easily mash
it with a fork.

Take it out, remove and discard the skin, and mash it with a fork until no or
few lumps remain.

### Prepare meat mixture

1. Dice the onion into square little pieces, bigger than a grain of rice but
   probably smaller than your pinky fingernail.
2. Mix together all ingredients, breaking up the ground meat and yam so it forms
   a homogenous paste.
   
### Make a test kabab to test salt and spiciness

Heat 1tsp oil in a pan (cast iron works great for this). Wet your hands. Take a
golf-ball sized amount of paste and roll it into a flat thick disk. Place it in
the oil. Cook about 3min until charred on one side, then flip over until browned
on the other side. It should form a nice brown-black crust.

Remove from pan and taste. Adjust the salt and spiciness of the remaining
mixture.

### Cook the rest

You can cook them several different ways:

 - On the stovetop on a cast iron pan just like the test kabab.
 - In the oven at 400F:
   - Formed into patties, just like the test kabab, on a baking sheet.
   - Formed into long seekhs on metal skewers or soaked bamboo chopsticks.
 - On the grill, formed into patties or onto skewers
